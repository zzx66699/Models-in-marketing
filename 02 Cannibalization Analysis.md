# Chapter2 Cannibalization Analysis
## 1. What is cannibalization?
In marketing strategy, cannibalization refers to a reduction in sales volume, sales revenue, or market share of one product as a result of the introduction of a new product by the same producer.

## 2. What we need to analyse cannibalization?
1. unit profit of all offerings    
2. initial demand if existing product  
3. forecast demand of new product  
4. expected cannibalization of exsiting offer  

## 3. Cannibalization unit & Cannibalization rate  
Cannibalization unit is the loss of demand of exsiting product, and we think this loss is due to the new product    
Cannibalization rate is the quantity of new product that are stolen from the existing.    
for example, if it is 30%, we may say 30% of the demand of the new product is taken from the existing.    
```
Cannibalization rate = Quantity loss of existing product / Quantity of new product 
```

## 4.  Simple model  
compare   
the forecast profit from existing product without the launch of new product   
with   
the actual profit from both new product and existing product  
if delta profit > 0, then it is profitable to launch the new product, vice versa
